\section{Module 8: Roadmap -- Interactive Jupyter XVA Sandbox}

\subsection{8.1 Roadmap Overview}
We are actively designing an embedded Jupyter experience that will let learners explore XVA concepts with live Python-powered notebooks directly inside the course. The roadmap highlights milestones required to transform the module into a hands-on sandbox once infrastructure is complete.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Kernel management:} provision secure, short-lived kernels tailored to derivative pricing workflows.
    \item \textbf{Curated notebooks:} ship pre-built scenarios that quantify CVA, DVA, and FVA adjustments with reproducible code cells.
    \item \textbf{Data connectivity:} connect to example market data sets so learners can run shock analyses without leaving the browser.
\end{itemize}

Participants are encouraged to master the theoretical modules now and prepare to apply them in a dynamic computational setting as the Interactive Jupyter XVA Sandbox comes online.
