# Graduate-Level Course: XVA in Financial Markets

## Course Overview

This graduate-level course provides a comprehensive exploration of XVA (X-Value Adjustments) in financial markets, focusing on Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA), Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA), Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA), and Margin Valuation Adjustment (MVA). The course will delve into the theoretical foundations, mathematical formulations, practical applications, and regulatory implications of these crucial adjustments in derivative pricing and risk management. Students will gain a deep understanding of how XVA impacts financial institutions, derivative trading, and capital allocation.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

*   Understand the fundamental concepts and rationale behind XVA.
*   Differentiate between CVA, DVA, FVA, and MVA, and their respective roles in derivative valuation.
*   Comprehend the mathematical models and methodologies used for calculating each XVA component.
*   Analyze the practical challenges and complexities involved in XVA implementation and management.
*   Evaluate the impact of regulatory frameworks (e.g., Basel III) on XVA and capital requirements.
*   Discuss current trends and controversies in the XVA landscape.
